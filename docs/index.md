OPKSSH lets you connect to hosts with short-lived SSH certificates from [OpenPubkey](https://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh). You sign in with your identity provider, like Google, Microsoft or your own Keycloak, and Termix gets a certificate that lasts 24 hours. No passwords or long-lived keys on your hosts.

Termix ships a pinned, checksum verified copy of `opkssh`, so there is nothing to install on the Termix server.

## Before you start

- **Each host** needs OPKSSH installed and set up to trust your identity provider and your user. Follow the [OPKSSH install guide](https://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh#getting-started).
- **An OAuth client** at your identity provider, with a client ID and secret.

## Set it up

1. Install the plugin from the **Plugins** tab.
2. Open **Settings**, **OPKSSH** and copy the **Redirect URI**. It looks like `https://termix.example.com/plugin-api/opkssh/callback`. Register it as an allowed redirect URI with every identity provider you use.
3. Connect to an OPKSSH host once (see below). Termix writes a starter config file the first time.
4. Edit the config file. In Docker it is `/app/data/plugin-data/opkssh/config.yml`. Add your provider:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - alias: google
       issuer: https://accounts.google.com
       client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
       client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
       scopes: openid email profile
       access_type: offline
       prompt: consent
   ```

   See the [OPKSSH config docs](https://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh/blob/main/docs/config.md) for other providers.

Leave `redirect_uris` out. In OPKSSH it only lists localhost ports for its own listener. Termix gives your identity provider the public Redirect URI itself.

## Use it on a host

1. Open the host in **Manage**.
2. Set **Authentication Method** to **OPKSSH** and save.
3. Connect. Termix asks you to sign in. Press **Open Browser to Authenticate**, sign in with your provider, and the connection carries on.

The certificate is kept for 24 hours, so you sign in about once a day. It works for the terminal, file manager, Docker and every other plugin that connects over SSH.

## Troubleshooting

- **The config file can't be written.** In Docker, make sure `/app/data` is a volume the container's user can write.
- **The provider says the redirect URI is wrong.** Register the exact **Redirect URI** from settings, including the scheme. Behind a reverse proxy, make sure it sends `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
- **The host refuses the certificate.** Check the host's OPKSSH policy lists your email and provider.
